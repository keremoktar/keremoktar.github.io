# The Science of Disagreement.
My research aims to clarify the psychological and computational basis of disagreement---across scales, domains, and agents---from definition to intervention [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3380n01h). 

We disagree---collectively, forcefully, and frequently. We disagree in business meetings and family dinners; about scientific issues and moral questions; with loved ones and with millions of strangers. Yet our understanding of disagreement is 

[id1]: ## "For instance, compared to other topics in philosophy, the study of disagreement is “a mere infant” that has focused almost exclusively on disagreement among peers (Frances & Matheson, 2019). In the sociological literature on large-scale opinion dynamics, “basic empirical questions about how to underpin model assumptions (e.g., about how individuals respond to evidence from disagreement) remain unanswered” (Flache et al., 2017). Similarly, relevant work in political science rests on “a rather shaky foundation; there are legitimate differences of opinion---sometimes explicit, often implicit---about what disagreement is” (Klofstad et al., 2013)."

My research brings together insights from social and cognitive psychology, epistemology, and probability theory to further our understanding disagreement. Taken together, it shows how we can overwhelmingly persist in our views amid disagreement---even when millions disagree---yet maintain sufficient flexibility to learn from others in the right circumstances. 

## I also study belief and decision-making. 
In particular, I am interested in when deeply important beliefs---such as whether abortion is moral---can be _changed_ [(Oktar et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105434); and 
how people decide _how to decide_ [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722000099).

### I also also study the philosophy of disagreement.
Paradoxically, how we ought to react to disagreement is a point of disagreement: 
> “There is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men” (Hume, 1758)
“The floating of other men's opinions in our brains makes us not one jot the more knowing, though they happen to be true” (Locke, 1690)
Many excellent philosophical studies of disagreement exist; but they typically focus on peer disagreement. I am interested in scaling up philosophical analyses of disagreement to the societal level.
