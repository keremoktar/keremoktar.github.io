# What is Disagreement?
My research aims to clarify the psychological and computational basis of disagreement---across scales, domains, and agents---from definition to intervention [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022).](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3380n01h).

I also study belief and decision-making. In particular, I am interested in when deeply important beliefs---such as whether abortion is moral---can be changed [(Oktar et al., 2023).](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105434); and 
how people decide how to decide [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722000099).
