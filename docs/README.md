# The Science of Disagreement.
My research aims to clarify the psychological and computational basis of disagreement---across scales, domains, and agents---from definition to intervention.

## How Beliefs Persist When Millions Disagree:
We disagree---collectively, forcefully, and frequently. We disagree in business meetings and violent protests; about scientific issues and moral questions; with loved ones and with millions of strangers. 

Despite much research, our understanding of disagreement is quite limited (see, e.g., [Klofstad, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00620.x)). My work brings together insights from social and cognitive psychology, epistemology, and probability theory to shed light on this important phenomenon.

Currently, I am developing and testing a model of how we overwhelmingly persist in our views amid disagreement---even when millions disagree---yet maintain sufficient flexibility to learn from others in the right circumstances [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3380n01h).  

## I also study belief and decision-making.
In particular, I am interested in when deeply important beliefs---such as whether abortion is moral---can be _changed_ [(Oktar et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105434); and 
how people decide _how to decide_, that is, choose to rely on their intuition and deliberation when making decisions across domains [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722000099).

## Who am I?
Here's a short summary: I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey; studied economics and cognitive science at Pomona College in California; and am currently working with a fantastic [community of collaborators](./collaborators.md) on the questions described above. 

Like many, my research is motivated by my past. I left Turkey to study in the U.S because I thought it was collapsing economically and losing its democratic, secular values (this turned out to be [true](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-liberal-democracy-in-turkey-implications-for-the-west/)). Participating in the Gezi Park [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezi_Park_protests) made me acutely aware of the importance of dissent---and our remarkable, violent capacity for it. Since then, I have been trying to understand how and when others' beliefs influence ours.
