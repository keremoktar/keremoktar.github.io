# The Science of Disagreement.
My research aims to clarify the psychological and computational basis of disagreement---across scales, domains, and agents---from definition to intervention [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3380n01h). 

We disagree---collectively, forcefully, and frequently. We disagree in business meetings and family dinners; about scientific issues and moral questions; with loved ones and with millions of strangers. Yet our understanding of disagreement is surprisingly limited.


, when faced with controversy, we do not merely get swept up in torrents of mass opinion, nor do we remain permanently stuck to our individual views. Instead, we are flexibly anchored to our beliefs. What drives this capacity for adaptive persistence, however, is unknown—partially due to large gaps in our understanding of disagreement. Theoretically, we lack a definition of disagreement and a formal analysis of how we ought to update our beliefs when we disagree. Behaviorally, we lack a comprehensive understanding of what drives people’s responses to disagreement. Computationally, we lack an algorithmic analysis of what underlies inferences from others’ dissenting opinions at scale. In my dissertation, I will present three studies that bring together insights from social and cognitive psychology, epistemology, and probability theory to further our understanding of these questions. Taken together, these studies shed light on the mechanisms that drive persistent disagreement and hence enable polarization. 

I also study **belief** and **decision-making**. In particular, I am interested in when deeply important beliefs---such as whether abortion is moral---can be _changed_ [(Oktar et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105434); and 
how people decide _how to decide_ [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722000099).
