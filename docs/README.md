  <h1> The Science of Disagreement </h1>
</div>
My research aims to clarify the psychological and computational basis of disagreement---across scales, domains, and agents---from definition to intervention.

Here are two ongoing projects I am most excited about:<br><br>
**_Why do controversies persist?_** On controversies from abortion to vaccination, we typically know that millions disagree with us, yet remain anchored to our beliefs. Our framework explains why we persist through four mechanisms [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2024)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/9t6va){:target="_blank"}. <br><br>
**_How do we avoid manipulation?_** I am developing a computational model of how people learn from motivated communication. This model explains why we trust word-of-mouth recommendations (but not ads), and provides a novel explanation of polarization [(Oktar, Sumers, & Griffiths, 2024)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3kv0c8b7#main){:target="_blank"}.

_Is abortion morally acceptable? Is the Earth getting warmer? Should vaccines be mandatory?_<br>
Beliefs about such issues shape society. And people form these beliefs collectively, by negotiating differences in their views; learning from each other in some cases, and ignoring dissent in others. The goal of my research program is to understand the cognitive mechanisms that shape beliefs on such controversies---including how people navigate disagreements and change their views.

I pursue this goal through multiple methods: I construct theories that identify the inductive problems people solve to navigate controversies, build computational models that provide optimal solutions to these problems, and test these models by comparing their predictions to human behavior across scientific, religious, moral, and political controversies. I then use these insights in theory-based interventions that leverage cutting-edge tools (e.g., large language models) to foster productive engagement with diverse perspectives.  

My research operates at two levels of analysis. At one level, I study how people respond to an increasingly prevalent form of social information: the aggregated opinions of hundreds to millions of strangers (e.g., in the form of likes, polls, and votes). At another level, I examine responses to the conflicting testimony of known individuals.

## What drives our beliefs and decisions?
I also study when deeply important beliefs---such as whether abortion is moral---can be _changed_ [(Oktar et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105434){:target="_blank"}; and am interested in how people decide _how to decide_ [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722000099){:target="_blank"}.

## Who am I?
I was born and raised in Istanbul (Turkey); studied economics and cognitive science at Pomona College (CA); and am currently at Princeton (NJ), advancing research alongside a fantastic [community of collaborators](./collaborators.md){:target="_blank"}.

Like many, my research is motivated by my past. I left Turkey to study in the U.S because I thought it was collapsing economically and losing its democratic, secular values (this turned out to be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-liberal-democracy-in-turkey-implications-for-the-west/">true</a>). Participating in the Gezi Park <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezi_Park_protests">protests</a> made me acutely aware of the importance of dissent---and our remarkable capacity for it. Since then, I have been trying to understand how and when others' beliefs influence ours. <br><br>
