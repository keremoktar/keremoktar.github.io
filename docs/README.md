# The Science of Disagreement.
My research aims to clarify the psychological and computational basis of disagreement---across scales, domains, and agents---from definition to intervention.

Currently, I am developing and testing a model of how we both persist in our views amid societal controversy, yet maintain sufficient flexibility to learn from others [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3380n01h).

We disagree---collectively, forcefully, and frequently. We disagree in business meetings and violent protests; about scientific issues and moral questions; with loved ones and with millions of strangers. 
<br><br>
Despite much research, our understanding of disagreement is quite limited (see, e.g., Klofstad, 2013). My work brings together insights from social and cognitive psychology, epistemology, and probability theory to shed light on this important phenomenon.<br><br>
I suggest that there are four distinct dimensions of disagreement that determine our responses to it, and that effective interventions aimed towards changing beliefs need to be tailored to these dimensions. <br><br>

## What drives our beliefs and decisions?
I also study when deeply important beliefs---such as whether abortion is moral---can be _changed_ [(Oktar et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105434); and am interested in how people decide _how to decide_ [(Oktar & Lombrozo, 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722000099).

## Who am I?
I was born and raised in Istanbul (Turkey); studied economics and cognitive science at Pomona College (CA); and am currently at Princeton (NJ), advancing research alongside a fantastic [community of collaborators](./collaborators.md).

Like many, my research is motivated by my past. I left Turkey to study in the U.S because I thought it was collapsing economically and losing its democratic, secular values (this turned out to be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-liberal-democracy-in-turkey-implications-for-the-west/">true</a>). Participating in the Gezi Park <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezi_Park_protests">protests</a> made me acutely aware of the importance of dissent---and our remarkable capacity for it. Since then, I have been trying to understand how and when others' beliefs influence ours. <br><br>
