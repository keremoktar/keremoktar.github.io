# The Hidden Curriculum.
Coming from a liberal arts college, I had no idea how to apply to graduate school, let alone talk to academics during interviews. I decided to write down what I wish someone had told me when I was nervously googling what a research statement was. 

- Understand that the goal of the admissions committee is to figure out who, amongst the massive stack of applications, *will do research most effectively*. Thus, as an applicant, your goal is to convey that you are ( / have the capacity to become) an outstanding researcher.
  - This point is key. You are not trying to convince them that you are the smartest person, nor the person most interested in psychology, nor the most accomplished academically. You are trying to convince them that you can develop into a good researcher.
  - As someone considering grad school, I imagine that you are naturally curious, have broad interests, and love learning, so you will likely want to emphasize these aspects of yourself in your applications, as you should---but your primary emphasis should be on how all of these wonderful qualities about you come together to help you do good research. 

- Make sure that your application is tailored to a particular member of the faculty. The idea here isn’t so much that you should make yourself seem like someone a professor would like to work with, but to make sure you find the faculty who best align with your previous research experience and interests.
  - For example, if you have worked at a social cognition lab, gave a presentation on implicit bias at a social conference, etc., you may have a hard time selling yourself to a cognitive neuroscientist. I made this mistake in my applications (of applying to labs that sounded maximally interesting but that I had minimal experience in) and ended up with rejections as a consequence. 
    - I wish I had applied to more faculty that worked on judgment and decision-making, for example, because that’s what I had done  in undergrad.

- Be transparent in your applications, and do a lot of introspection--why do _you_ really want to do academic research in psychology? If you can confidently answer that question, writing your application materials will be much easier.
  - Don’t worry if you can’t. I struggled with this one a lot. You’re not supposed to have your life figured out (in fact, one’s identity may not be figure out-able), but if you can find a narrative about yourself that is at least somewhat compelling to you, you should stick with it. It’s all about telling a convincing story. 
    - Unfortunately, this part of the game involves selling yourself, and it’s easier to sell a product if you believe in it; so find a story about yourself that you can believe, too.  

- Apply widely (unless you have personal connections and can leverage your network to tailor your application to a particular lab, in which case you likely don’t need this advice anyway). Think of your applications sort of like independent draws (since there is a lot of stochasticity in admissions processes): if you apply to 1 program, and you have a 10% chance of getting in, you probably won’t get in. If you apply to 10 programs, 1 – (0.9)^10 =  65% chance of getting in; with 20, it’s 88%! This is a poor approximation, of course, but your best shot at getting into grad school is to have many (10 would be a reasonable lower bound applications.

- All of this assumes that you are sure you want to do grad school. *Think about that decision very carefully.* Look at the picture below -- it is from [2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2706), yet the trend is obvious: It is getting incredibly hard, no matter how good you are, to get any kind of stable, desirable academic job.
  - In my opinion, you should therefore only do a PhD if you love it, and if it significantly increases the number of career options beyond academia you might have (unless you are very priviliged, in which case, congratulations, and think about donating your wealth to a [valuable cause](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities))
