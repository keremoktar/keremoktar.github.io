# The Hidden Curriculum: A Guide.
I had to build my academic career from the ground up, and the amount of implicit gatekeeping at each step has been shocking. This document is my attempt at making the expectations, norms, and reality of academia transparent and accessible.

### <a name="truth"></a> Should _you_ choose academia?
At its best, academia is truly wonderful. We expand the [frontiers of knowledge](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/), contemplate the deepest mysteries of the universe, and consume ungodly volumes of caffeine.

As such, many guides to grad school applications assume that you are sure you want to do academia. As time goes by, this implicit assumption becomes an expectation, and many find themselves stuck. Since you are thinking of applying now, it is **extremely important** that you frame this to your self as **a choice**. If you have a PhD in mind, _this is your choice for how to spend the next **5-7** years of probably the most youthful, healthy, and independent years of your life; and on average **15%** of your working career._[^1] 
**
How can you make a decision like this? There are many considerations -- here are some generally applicable ones:

#### How likely are you to get an academic job after doing a PhD? 
A very rough estimate of this depends on how many academic jobs there are, relative to people with PhDs. Here is a graph of this statistic for STEM fields from a [2013 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2706) that makes the trend very obvious. Even a decade ago, less than 10% of PhDs could get academic jobs; now, it's likely to be much worse.[^2]

So right off the bat, the odds aren't great, especially considering that the average PhD grad (with whom you are competing with) is quite smart, competitive, and capable. Who are the 10% that get jobs then? Mostly graduates from the most elite programs: 80% of those that get jobs come from the top 20% of universities, according to a [2022 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05222-x), and there is striking inequality even within the top 20 programs:

![phd_job_inequality](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-022-05222-x/MediaObjects/41586_2022_5222_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp)

#### How likely are _you_ to get a _good_ academic job after doing a PhD? 
So everyone doesn't really have a 10% chance. Some have better odds: at the most prestigious programs, placement can be [around 30%](https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0285330). However, these are the odds of getting _any_ job. When it comes to jobs at the top 15% of institutions, 80% of the faculty come from the elite programs, and only 5% come from 75% of schools, as per a [2015 study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400005). In a nutshell, getting good academic jobs is extremely challenging.

Are you likely to be one of those people? That depends on many things; in part, your privilege and network. For instance, PhD's who have parents who also had PhD's are twice as likely to get faculty jobs as those whose parents did not have PhDs, as the following figure from a [2022 study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01425-4) shows. 

![phd_job_parents](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41562-022-01425-4/MediaObjects/41562_2022_1425_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)

#### How will getting a PhD impact your job search outside of academia? 
It depends, but overall, [an analysis by the Economist](https://medium.economist.com/why-doing-a-phd-is-often-a-waste-of-time-349206f9addb) claims that PhDs don't confer advantage or employment benefits beyond master's degrees, and that advantage is roughly a 25% increase over Bachelor's degrees. 

But this average hides tremendous variation: If you change fields and end up with a good degree in a highly employable field (e.g., AI/ML/Econ), your job prospects will likely increase a lot.  Similarly, if you are an international student from a struggling economy, doing a graduate degree can help you emigrate, which will improve your prospects. And if you get into a good school you can build a strong network.

#### How much will I enjoy the PhD process?
This also depends, but overall, around a [third to half of graduate students](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41578-022-00444-x) are depressed or anxious, a much higher rate than the U.S average of around ~10-20%. The outlook for underprivileged students (minorities, international students, LGBTQ+ groups, etc.) tends to be worse, according to a large analysis of [UC Berkeley students](https://gradresources.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/wellbeingreport_2014-17.pdf). 

Will this apply to you? Given that the strongest predictor of stress and unhappiness were bad job prospects (rather than individual differences), it is likely to.

#### So should you get a PhD?
This all sounds quite bleak. And it is, _for most academics_. However, there are academics who are quite happy. I am one (for now). But it is important to make an informed choice.

In my judgment, these facts show that you should only _choose to do_ a PhD if:
- you think you will really enjoy it,
   - e.g., you **love** learning and aren't materialistic; you are rich and can [Montaigne it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne); you [discount time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference) like there's no tomorrow; etc.
- it is likely to increase your career prospects,
   - e.g., you transition to a more in-demand field; you acquire highly valued skills; you move to a better economy; etc.
- or you are deeply driven by values that align with education beyond personal or material satisfaction,
   - and are sure that those values will uphold over time.

Importantly, you should not do a PhD _because_ you have a dream of becoming a well-paid elite college professor. That dream is unlikely to become true, for anyone. Especially those of us whose parents aren't professors, who don't come from money, and in general, who aren't privileged. You should do a PhD _if_ you think the PhD itself will confer value to you. 

[^1]: Average college graduation age = 24; average retirement age = 63. Therefore average career length = 63 - 24 = 39. Average PhD length = 6 years. Percent of career spent on PhD = 6/39 = 15%.
[^2]: There are, on average, around 3000 STEM faculty jobs that open up each year, according to the 2013 paper. But there are 35000 PhDs awarded; 3000/35000 < 10%.

### <a name="general"></a> General Application Advice.
If you're still reading, you're likely set on applying. Congratulations, and buckle up. 

Understand that the goal of the admissions committee is to figure out who, amongst the massive stack of applications, *will do research most effectively*. Thus, as an applicant, your goal is to convey that you are ( / have the capacity to become) an outstanding researcher.
  - This point is key. You are not trying to convince them that you are the smartest person, nor the one who most deserves this career, nor the person most interested in psychology, nor the most accomplished academically. You are trying to convince them that you can develop into a good researcher.
    
Always apply widely (unless you have personal connections and can leverage your network to tailor your application to particular labs
- Think of your applications sort of like independent draws (there is a lot of stochasticity in admissions processes): if you apply to 1 program, and you have a 10% chance of getting in, you probably won’t get in. If you apply to 10 programs, 1 – (0.9)^10 =  65% chance of getting in; with 20, it’s 88%! This is a poor approximation, of course, but your best shot at getting into grad school is to have many (10 would be a reasonable lower bound applications.

### <a name="documents"></a> Writing the Documents. 

> Needless to say, the documents would mean an almost endless amount of work. It was easy to come to the belief, not only for those of an anxious disposition, that it was impossible ever to finish it. (Kafka, The Trial, pg. 152).

Every admissions website tells you what documents they want: the personal statement and the CV. But they don’t always tell you how to write them; and it can feel like an impossible task that will take forever. There are three key tricks to writing these kinds of documents.
1. Here’s the first trick: Figure out what they want from you before you start working on them. 
   - MIT has excellent guides on the [personal statement]( https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/graduate-school-personal-statement/) and the [resume]( https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/cvresume/). Read these now, and carefully look at the annotated examples at the bottom of the page. 
   - One mistake I see people make often is stating that you are naturally curious, have broad interests, and love learning----which are probably true---but your primary emphasis should be on how all of these wonderful qualities about you come together to help you do good research. 
   - To some extent, learning how to write these documents is about seeing a lot of them. So search the internet for successful application materials; there’s a ton (e.g., google ‘Harvard personal statement example’).
     
2. Second trick: Tailor your application. In some fields (like psychology), you do not just apply to a department, but to work with a specific person. You want this person to feel like you are the perfect fit for them. 
   - The idea here isn’t so much that you should make yourself seem like someone a professor would like to work with, but to make sure you find the faculty who best align with your previous research experience and interests.  
   - For example, if you have worked at a social cognition lab, gave a presentation on implicit bias at a social conference, etc., you may have a hard time selling yourself to a cognitive neuroscientist. I made this mistake in my applications (of applying to labs that sounded maximally interesting but that I had minimal experience in) and ended up with rejections as a consequence. I wish I had applied to more faculty that worked on judgment and decision-making, for example, because that’s what I had done  in undergrad.
   - How can you best tailor your application? Reach out to the professor, or the people in their lab --- they will know what the current research directions are (and whether you want to work with this person at all).
     
3. Third trick: Find a way to work consistently. People struggle with this a lot. You can try to read some [self-help book summaries](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/atomic-habits-james-clear). What has worked for me is having external accountability: Break your task into chunks, and tell someone that you will have the chunk ready for them by a certain time. The more the chunks, the more the deadlines, the less likely you are to just procrastinate until the final deadline.

### <a name="network"></a> Building a Network.

> The only things of real value are honest personal contacts, contacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower grades, you understand. That is the only way the progress of the  trial can be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it’s true, but from then on it becomes more and more visible. (Kafka, The Trial, pg. 139).
