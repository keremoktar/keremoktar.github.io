# The Hidden Curriculum: A Guide.

Here’s one way to understand society:

You, me, and everyone else are colorful marbles, and life is a sequence of obstacles. Success is where we land after bouncing through life: The right side corresponds to success (money, status), the left side to failure (poverty, obscurity). These obstacles aren’t always choices: Some start life with a lot of money, some with very little; some have bodies that work, and others don’t, etc. These are *privileges,* and they typically influence your life from very early on.
This means that the privileged do not see a lot of the obstacles many encounter. They may not know that there are some obstacles put in place just to limit who succeeds (e.g., quotas on immigration). Sometimes even the disadvantaged do not know these obstacles exist. This is the hidden curriculum. 
And this document is an evolving guide to the hidden curriculum in academia.

## <a name="general"></a> General Graduate School Application Advice
- Understand that the goal of the admissions committee is to figure out who, amongst the massive stack of applications, *will do research most effectively*. Thus, as an applicant, your goal is to convey that you are ( / have the capacity to become) an outstanding researcher.
  - This point is key. You are not trying to convince them that you are the smartest person, nor the one who most deserves this career, nor the person most interested in psychology, nor the most accomplished academically. You are trying to convince them that you can develop into a good researcher.
- Always apply widely (unless you have personal connections and can leverage your network to tailor your application to a particular lab, in which case you likely don’t need this advice anyway). Think of your applications sort of like independent draws (there is a lot of stochasticity in admissions processes): if you apply to 1 program, and you have a 10% chance of getting in, you probably won’t get in. If you apply to 10 programs, 1 – (0.9)^10 =  65% chance of getting in; with 20, it’s 88%! This is a poor approximation, of course, but your best shot at getting into grad school is to have many (10 would be a reasonable lower bound applications.
- All of this assumes that you are sure you want to do academia. *Think about that decision very carefully.* Look at the picture below -- it is from [2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2706), yet the trend is obvious: It is getting incredibly hard, no matter how good you are, to get any kind of stable, desirable academic job.
  - In my opinion, you should therefore only do a PhD if you love it, and if it significantly increases the number of career options beyond academia you might have.

## <a name="documents"></a> How to Approach the Documents 
> Needless to say, the documents would mean an almost endless amount of work. It was easy to come to the belief, not only for those of an anxious disposition, that it was impossible ever to finish it. (Kafka, The Trial, pg. 152).

Every admissions website tells you what documents they want: the personal statement and the CV. But they don’t always tell you how to write them; and it can feel like an impossible task that will take forever. There are three key tricks to writing these kinds of documents.
1. Here’s the first trick: Figure out what they want from you before you start working on them. 
   - MIT has excellent guides on the [personal statement]( https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/graduate-school-personal-statement/) and the [resume]( https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/cvresume/). Read these now, and carefully look at the annotated examples at the bottom of the page. 
   - One mistake I see people make often is stating that you are naturally curious, have broad interests, and love learning----which are probably true---but your primary emphasis should be on how all of these wonderful qualities about you come together to help you do good research. 
   - To some extent, learning how to write these documents is about seeing a lot of them. So search the internet for successful application materials; there’s a ton (e.g., google ‘Harvard personal statement example’).  
2. Second trick: Tailor your application. In some fields (like psychology), you do not just apply to a department, but to work with a specific person. You want this person to feel like you are the perfect fit for them. 
   - The idea here isn’t so much that you should make yourself seem like someone a professor would like to work with, but to make sure you find the faculty who best align with your previous research experience and interests.
  - For example, if you have worked at a social cognition lab, gave a presentation on implicit bias at a social conference, etc., you may have a hard time selling yourself to a cognitive neuroscientist. I made this mistake in my applications (of applying to labs that sounded maximally interesting but that I had minimal experience in) and ended up with rejections as a consequence. I wish I had applied to more faculty that worked on judgment and decision-making, for example, because that’s what I had done  in undergrad.
   - How can you best tailor your application? Reach out to the professor, or the people in their lab --- they will know what the current research directions are (and whether you want to work with this person at all). 
3. Third trick: Find a way to work consistently. People struggle with this a lot. You can try to read some [self-help book summaries](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/atomic-habits-james-clear). What has worked for me is having external accountability: Break your task into chunks, and tell someone that you will have the chunk ready for them by a certain time. The more the chunks, the more the deadlines, the less likely you are to just procrastinate until the final deadline.
