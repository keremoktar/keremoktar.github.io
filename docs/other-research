# This is not an exhaustive list! 
I am curious about cognitive science quite broadly, so feel free to reach out if you want to chat about anything! Here are some of the more direct areas of inquiry:

## The Psychology of Epistemic Vigilance
As part of ongoing collaborations with Ted Sumers, I am developing and testing computational model of epistemic vigilance.

## The Psychology of Suspended Judgment
Could suspended judgment be related to optimal stopping and decision theory?

## The philosophy of disagreement
Paradoxically, how we ought to react to testimony in broad terms, and disagreement in particular, is a point of disagreement: 

> “There is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men” (Hume, 1758)

> “The floating of other men's opinions in our brains makes us not one jot the more knowing, though they happen to be true” (Locke, 1690)

Many excellent philosophical studies of disagreement exist; but they typically focus on peer disagreement. I am interested in scaling up philosophical analyses of disagreement to the societal level.

## Other stuff
To be constructed...
