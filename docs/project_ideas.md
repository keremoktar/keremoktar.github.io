# Ideas are cheap.

Execution is expensive. So keep that in mind when choosing one of these to pursue!

## Disagreement:

### Social: 
- Do people judge disagreeing others as uglier?

## Intuition: 
- Is there a link between intuition and authenticity *because* we learn about our own preferences in some domains, but not others? 
- Is Sosa (2021; Epistemic Explanations) right that what differentiates intuitive vs. deliberative domains is not our access to second-hand evidence, but rather our access to first-hand evidence ['knowledge through deference seems again available.']? It seems like you can get second-hand evidence from others' opinions for almost anything; but he equates understanding with first-hand intuitive grasp.
