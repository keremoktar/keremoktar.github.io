# Some Words are Worth a Thousand Pictures.
This is a growing, unordered list of some of my favorite papers/books, and why I think you should read them. 

## Cognitive Science:
- Griffiths, T. L. (2020). Understanding human intelligence through human limitations. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 24(11), 873-883. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2020.09.001)
  - _Reasoning is so central to humanity that we named ourselves 'discerning hominids' (homo sapiens). How should we understand ourselves, then, if our creations (AI) are more discerning than we are? Tom argues that there is a unique flavor of intelligence that characterizes humans, and that this flavor is characterized by constraints on our time, computation, and communication. I think that this is a much more principled approach to understanding the psyche than generating ad hoc explanations for specific inferences/behavior. Though there are some constraints missing._ 
     
- Cushman, F. (2020). Rationalization is rational. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 43, e28. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X19001730)
  - _People can explain their own behavior. But a lot of clever research has shown that people's explanations do not always track their behavior. For example, you can get people to explain why they picked one identical dishwasher over another and they'll make some stuff up. This kind of evidence has long been taken to evidence the [shallowness of cognition](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300248531/the-mind-is-flat/), and our irrationality. Fiery offers a reasonable account of why our explanations may actually evidence learning mechanisms that allow us to understand ourselves. Though there is room for more nuanced mechanisms for meta-reasoning and self-narratives._
  
- Hofstadter, D. R. (1999). GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an eternal golden braid. Basic books.
  - _What does recursion have to do with cognition? What is recursion? What?_ 

## Meta-science:
- Almaatouq, A., et al. (2022). Beyond playing 20 questions with nature: Integrative experiment design in the social and behavioral sciences. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 1-55. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X22002874)
  - _A lot of psychology research doesn't replicate. Why? In part because our behavior depends on a very large number of variables that are not accounted for in studies. Abdoullah & Co outline a vision for scaling up psychology by systematically manipulating all of the relevant variables. This is a leap forward for improving psychological science. Though many issues remain: How can we power studies testing higher-order interactions? How can smaller, less-well-funded-than-MIT research groups contribute to science? How do we come up with the relevant variables?_ 
    
- Yarkoni, T. (2022). The generalizability crisis. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 45, e1. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X20001685)
  - _Why is our understanding of psychology so fraught? Tal makes similar observations to Abdoullah, but points out a crucial flaw that even massive experiments cannot address: Our rampant tendency to over-generalize our findings. Though how to remedy this problem remains an open question._
  
- Meehl, P. E. (1990). Why summaries of research on psychological theories are often uninterpretable. Psychological reports, 66(1), 195-244. [Link](https://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1990.66.1.195)
  - _Should we build on prior literature in psychology, as we are taught to, by citing and testing previous accounts? Meehl points out 16 (yes, really) reasons why prior research in psychology is more like quicksand than firm footing. Though how to remedy this problem remains an open question._

## Philosophy:
- Hardwig, J. (1985). Epistemic dependence. The Journal of philosophy, 82(7), 335-349. [Link](https://philarchive.org/rec/HARTRO-3)
  - _People's understanding seems shallow because the relevant unit for understanding is not individual people, but rather communities. Hardwig outlines the web of epistemic dependence that we find ourselves in._ 

- Kitcher, P. (1990). The division of cognitive labor. The journal of philosophy, 87(1), 5-22. [Link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2026796)
  - _How should we allocate our time and effort in science (and elsewhere)? Kitcher argues that the optimal individual policy for picking what to believe and study is societally suboptimal._
 
- Godfrey-Smith, P. (2009). Theory and reality: An introduction to the philosophy of science. University of Chicago Press.
  - _What is a theory? I've observed that many scientists (myself included) don't have good answers to this question. Reading this helped me understand why._
